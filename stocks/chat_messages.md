> let's set up this repo with python using uv. i want to be able to do basic visualization and graphs, hit some apis for stocks and inflation number

## Message 2
> yep let's do it.

## Message 3
> why have you chosen something for which i will need an api key? is there not a free option

## Message 4
> ok, lets do vt. i want to see from 2005 to 2025

## Message 5
> do we have to call the api again in order to see the charts?

## Message 6
> damn, was vt not around in 2005? what is a relatively global index that was and still exists

## Message 7
> let's do the 60/40 you recommended, 2005 - 2025.

## Message 8
> chart

## Message 9
> ok, i want to find the high pre-2009. we will pin inflation there as 1 so that we can have a horizontal line that shows us when we finally reach that high again, adjusted for inflation.

## Message 10
> add this whole calculation and graph philosophy to a recovery readme, with our methods

## Message 11
> why did we do 60/40 and what two stocks were they?

## Message 12
> ok, let's add a reference to the recovery md in the main readme, and then lets stage all the files about recovery and the necessary python etc

## Message 13
> do we need to add everything inside of stocks? also, i would like a couple of our graphs to be added. maybe we can have a folder for them

## Message 14
> i want you to create a chat_messages.md file that has every message i sent you in this chat. follow the example in anime folder
