# Research

Structured research on various topics.

## Overview

Research follows four steps:

1. **Requirements Gathering** (if needed) - Clarify constraints before diving in
2. **Setup** - Create folder and files
3. **Research** - Search systematically, log findings incrementally
4. **Synthesis** - Distill into a final report

Each topic gets its own folder. The separation of raw research (background.md) from clean output (report.md) keeps the mess of exploration separate from the final deliverable.

## Structure

```
{topic}/
├── requirements.md    # User constraints and context (if needed)
├── background.md      # Raw research notes, citations, excerpts
└── report.md          # Final distilled writeup
```

For comparison research (evaluating multiple options):

```
{topic}/
├── research_overview.md   # Criteria, sources, methodology
├── {option_1}.md          # Notes on each option
├── {option_2}.md
└── comparison_report.md   # Final analysis
```

## Requirements Gathering

If the research topic is ambiguous or has unstated constraints, clarify before diving in.

1. **Ask probing questions** - Short list, focused on what will shape the research
2. **Create requirements.md** - Capture the answers so they don't get lost
3. **Then start research** - Now you know what you're actually looking for

Examples of things to clarify:
- Budget or price constraints
- Must-have vs nice-to-have features
- Specific use case or context
- Who the output is for

Skip this step if the request is already clear and specific.

## Phase 1: Setup

Before any research, create the folder and files.

### Checklist

1. Create a folder for the topic (lowercase with hyphens, e.g., `message-queue-comparison`)
2. Create `background.md` with:
   - Header with research topic and date
   - Empty `## Sources` section
   - Empty `## Key Findings` section
3. If requirements were gathered, ensure `requirements.md` captures user constraints

For comparison research, also create `research_overview.md` with criteria and methodology.

## Phase 2: Research

### Planning Searches

Plan 5-10 initial searches across these categories:
- Core concepts and definitions
- Current best practices
- Common challenges and solutions
- Recent developments and trends
- Authoritative sources (official docs, academic papers, expert opinions)

### Search Principles

- **Use open-ended queries** - Don't pre-specify expected answers
- **Prioritize quality sources** - Target reputable sites for the domain (journals, official docs, expert forums)
- **Note contradictions** - When sources disagree, capture both views
- **Match source age to topic velocity**:
  - Fast-moving fields (tech, pricing, current events) → prioritize recent sources
  - Stable domains (history, established science) → older authoritative sources still valuable
  - Mixed topics → recent for current state, older for foundational context

### After Each Search

After each search that yields useful results:

1. Append findings to `background.md` immediately—don't wait
2. Log the search query used
3. Record key information with source attribution
4. Note any follow-up questions or related topics discovered

If a search yields nothing useful, note this briefly and move on.

### Targeted Searches

After initial searches, you'll discover topics needing deeper exploration. Create a second round of searches based on what you've learned—use the follow-up questions you noted.

### Background File Format

- Organize by topic with `## Section` headers
- Bold key findings for scannability
- Use markdown reference-style links at end of each section
- Include publication/source in link text: `([Source: Title][1])`
- Include dates for time-sensitive information (pricing, versions, market data)
- Preserve nuance—don't flatten "debated" into "confirmed"
- Cross-reference important claims across multiple sources
- Be explicit about gaps—note when information is unavailable or uncertain

## Phase 3: Synthesis

### Executive Summary

Every report opens with a summary that answers the core question. The structure of the summary should be driven by the research topic itself—what matters depends on what you're researching.

- Lead with the conclusion or recommendation
- Include the key details that support it
- Keep it dense but readable—no filler, no throat-clearing

### Comparison Tables

Use tables when comparing options across objective factors. Good candidates:

- Pricing tiers
- Feature presence/absence
- Measurable specs
- Support for specific integrations

Avoid tables for subjective assessments (ease of use, quality, value). Those belong in prose where you can explain the reasoning.

### Tone

Write for a general audience while preserving rigor. Engaging without being overblown—no breathless superlatives but also no dry recitation.

- **Accessible** - Avoid jargon; when technical terms are necessary, provide context
- **Grounded** - Stick to what the evidence supports; flag uncertainty honestly
- **Restrained** - Trust the reader; no hype, no hedging everything into mush
