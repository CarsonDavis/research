**Genre**: Science Fiction, Horror, Fiction, Fantasy, Audiobook


### 2. The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller

**Genre**: Fantasy, Historical Fiction, Romance, Fiction, Mythology

**Potential concerns**: Narrator is observer, not driver of action


### 3. We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson

**Potential concerns**: Second half quality drop noted by many


### 5. The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker
