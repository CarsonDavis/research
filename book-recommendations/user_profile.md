- **Actionable insights** - Outlive praised for "tests and metrics you can do to assess your risk"
- **Digestible introductions** - Why Evolution Is True: "digestibility" makes it recommendable
- **Short and interesting** - Return of Martin Guerre: "short and interesting enough to make it an easy recommendation"
- **Science communication that doesn't over-simplify** - Fermat's Enigma: "He knows just how to tell a scientific story without grossly simplifying it"

## What They Hate

- **Boring storytelling** - First Human: "could make breaking news about invading aliens sound boring"
- **Missing the interesting parts** - First Human: "managed to leave out the most interesting parts or to restructure them in a way that robbed them of any human connection or drama"
- **Better alternatives exist** - First Human: actively avoid because "there are a host of better books that are more engaging while being equally informative"
- **Slog to get through** - Mao's Great Famine: "certainly not readable -- it is rather a slog to get through"
- **Questionable sources / bad logical leaps** - Alexandria: "the author stretches the truth or relies on bad logical leaps or untrustworthy sources"
- **Scholarly without broader context** - Summer of Fire and Blood: "lacked a general reader's overview", "a touch scholarly and lacked a bit of assumed context"
- **Making interesting boring** - Longitude: "takes the fascinating progress of early science...and renders it devoid of all intrigue and suspense"
- **Spoiling events before conclusion** - Longitude: "spoiling every great moment hundreds of pages before its narrative conclusion"
- **Telling events out of order** - Longitude: "constantly insisting on telling key events out of line"
- **Wikipedia summarization style** - Longitude: "dully recite the facts in a dry wikipedia summarization"
- **Speculation over facts** - Entangled Life: "speculation, philosophizing, and shoe-horned personal anecdotes"

**Notes:**
