> this is excellent, but let's incorporate one thing. I'm a sucker for expertly done action or for epic scenes, like solo leveling, one punch man, demon slayer, many of the fights in the luffy show, definitely tanya, AOT. it can't be the only thing a show has going for it, but i definitely like an epic scene, like when frieren's master unveils her power to instantly anihilate those demons
