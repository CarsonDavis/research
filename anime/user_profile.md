## What They Love

### Emotional Impact
- Sad/bittersweet endings that are EARNED (Fate, Grave of Fireflies)
- Shows that create "a pit in my stomach" or genuine loneliness
- Tragedy done beautifully
- Shows that make them cry (Your Lie in April: "spent entire second season crying")
- Waking up thinking about the show (Your Lie in April: woke at 5am thinking about it)
- **"Quiet sadness"** - subdued, sombre emotional currents - a consistent pattern:
  - March Comes in Like a Lion: "so subdued and sombre"
  - Maquia: "so quietly sad"
  - Haibane Renmei: "slow and gentle with undercurrent of deep sadness"
  - Mushishi: "gentle but often sad"
- **Deep unfairness** - Death Parade praised for "emotion and deep unfairness"
- Self-described "slut for emotional porn" (Plastic Memories review)
- **Refreshing brutality** - when shows commit to darkness/death (Goblin Slayer, Demon Slayer movie killing loveable character)
- **Actually killing characters** - Chainsaw Man: "HOLY SHIT THEY KILLED EVERYONE" (positive)
- **Execution over originality** - Chainsaw Man "cliched but they do such a good job with it"

### Character Depth
- Leads who actually grow and learn (Re:Zero: Subaru "gets better as a person")
- Well-developed side characters (Your Lie in April: praised side character development)
- Characters with real failures and growth (Assassination Classroom)

### Thematic Elements
- Philosophical depth (NGE praised for this)
- Emotional/psychological exploration

### Technical Quality
- Good cinematography and framing (NGE: "understands framing and composition")
- Artistic moments and striking visuals
- Strong camera work on faces (Portrait of a Lady on Fire)
- Dreamy/artistic visual style (Words Bubble Up, Garden of Words)

### Structural Elements
- Slow builds that pay off (Steins;Gate)
- Willing to power through slow starts if payoff is good
- Completed arcs with satisfying conclusions
- **Slow episodic formats** can work if emotionally resonant (Mushishi: "very slow, gentle but often sad")
- Appreciates shows that are "hard to recommend" but deeply affecting (Sonny Boy, Scum's Wish)

### Cute/Wholesome Done Right
- Spy x Family: "cutest most awesome show"
- Takagi-san: "so fucking cute"
- Kotaro Lives Alone: wholesome with emotional weight

### Epic Moments & Expertly Done Action
*Can't be the only thing a show has, but absolutely a draw*

- **Sucker for "hype" moments** - when a powerful character finally unveils their true power
  - Frieren's master instantly annihilating demons
  - Tanya's combat scenes
  - One Punch Man's fights
  - Solo Leveling
  - Attack on Titan
- **Well-animated action sequences** - Demon Slayer (Nezuko bamboo gag show), One Piece key fights
- Action needs substance behind it - can elevate a good show, but can't carry a bad one
- The payoff matters: epic scenes hit harder when earned through buildup

---

## What They Hate

### Deal-Breakers
*Elements that can ruin an otherwise good show*

- **No conflict/growth/fulfillment** - the cardinal sin (Smartphone: "one long extended cringefest")
- **Cop-out happy endings** when sad would fit better (Samurai Champloo: "EXTREMELY disappointed" everyone survived)
- **Rushed/cliff-notes adaptations** that lose character depth (Tokyo Ghoul S3)
- **Female leads as symbols rather than characters** (Fruit Basket criticism)
- **Nonsensical plot developments** (Promised Neverland S2: secret bunker, infinite battery pen, etc.)

### Pet Peeves
*Annoying but tolerable*

- Excessive filler (Naruto, Bleach)
- Cliche harem setups (DanMachi - tolerated but noted)
- Corny elements (tolerates if show is otherwise good)
- Heavy-handed metaphors (The Platform: "impossibly heavy handed and flawed")
- Childish themes dressed up as mature (Dragon Prince: "infantile character development")

### Red Flags
*Patterns that predict dislike*

- **Forced sad endings** - as bad as cop-out happy ones (Punch Line)
- Shows that peter out after strong starts (Bleach)
- **Edgy without substance** - Elfen Lied "popular only because of nudity and gratuitous killing"
- **Manufactured conflict** - Charlotte criticized for "shitty manufactured conflict"

---

## Tolerance Levels

| Element | Tolerance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Fanservice/Pervy | Medium-High | Will overlook if artistic merit is high (Bakemonogatari, Grimgar) |
| Plot holes | Low | Gets irritated by nonsensical plots (Promised Neverland S2) |
| Slow pacing | High | Appreciates slow/deliberate if it builds to something (Steins;Gate, Grimgar) |
| Harem tropes | Medium | Tolerates if lead grows/isn't pathetic (Re:Zero yes, generic no) |
| Unrealistic elements | Low | "Convenient writing" is a frequent complaint |

---

## Ending Preferences

### Preferred
- **Earned sad/bittersweet endings** - Fate/Stay Night praised for "rare well-done sad ending"
- Endings that create emotional weight, loneliness, a "pit in stomach"
- Would prefer Steins;Gate had sadder ending
- Tragedy that commits to being tragic

### Hated
- **Cop-out happy endings** - Samurai Champloo ruined by everyone magically surviving
- **Forced sad endings** - manufactured tragedy is just as bad (Punch Line)
- The key distinction: EARNED vs FORCED/COP-OUT

---

## Character Archetypes

### Loved
- **Stoic badasses** - Karasuma from Assassination Classroom: "such a fucking stud"

- **Badass female leads** - Hellsing Ultimate: "she gets so bad ass towards the end"

| Romance | Medium | Likes when done well, dislikes cliche |
