# Anime Recommendations

You've seen 200+ titles and have discerning taste: earned emotional payoffs, morally complex characters, dark themes done maturely, and endings that don't cop out. You hate contrived plots, weak characters, and childish bullshit dressed up as mature content.

Here's what you haven't seen that fits.

## The Heavy Hitters

### Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
*28 eps, ongoing*

The hero's journey is over. The demon king is dead. Now an immortal elf reflects on the decades she spent with companions who are now gone. A meditation on grief, regret, and the weight of time passing differently for different beings. Slow, contemplative, achingly beautiful. The kind of show that makes you stop and stare at nothing for a while.

**Vibe:** What if you lived so long that friendships became footnotes? What did you miss while you weren't paying attention?

### Pluto
*8 eps, complete*

A robot detective investigates the murders of the world's most powerful robots. From the creator of Monster. Part Blade Runner, part Silence of the Lambs, all noir. Adult protagonist, grounded storytelling, themes of war trauma and what makes us human. 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.

**Vibe:** Monster but sci-fi. Thoughtful, tense, mature.

### Made in Abyss
*~25 eps equivalent across series + films*

Two children descend into a massive pit filled with wonders and horrors. The deeper you go, the worse things get. Looks like a children's adventure anime. It is not. This show will hurt you.

**Vibe:** What if Studio Ghibli made a Lovecraftian horror? Enchanting and traumatizing in equal measure.

**Note:** Some viewers find certain scenes with child characters uncomfortable. Worth knowing going in.

### Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni)
*12 eps (manga continues much further)*

Gem-beings fight off creatures from the moon. One weak gem desperately wants to be useful. What follows is arguably the most dramatic character transformation in anime. They don't just grow - they become unrecognizable. Gorgeous CGI, Buddhist themes about identity and impermanence.

**Vibe:** Beautiful and alienating. Watching someone change so fundamentally you mourn who they were.

## Excellent Picks

### Code Geass
*50 eps*

Exiled prince gets a power that lets him command anyone to obey one order. Uses it to lead a rebellion. Strategic cat-and-mouse thriller with one of the most iconic endings in anime. Morally grey protagonist who does terrible things for "good" reasons.

**Vibe:** Death Note with mechs and higher stakes.

### 86 (Eighty-Six)
*23 eps*

A nation claims to fight a war with autonomous drones. The "drones" are actually piloted by an oppressed ethnic group fighting from a death camp while society pretends they don't exist. Discrimination, trauma, and characters who aren't protected by plot armor.

**Vibe:** War is hell, and the people who suffer aren't the ones making decisions.

### Dorohedoro
*12 eps + OVAs*

Man with reptile head wanders a nightmarish city ruled by sorcerers, biting people's heads to find who cursed him. Violent, bizarre, darkly funny. Doesn't take itself too seriously while still delivering.

**Vibe:** If you like weird shit that fully commits to being weird shit.

### Girls' Last Tour
*12 eps*

Two girls traverse a post-apocalyptic wasteland. They talk about life, meaning, and what it means to keep going when everything is already over. Contemplative slice-of-life in a dead world.

**Vibe:** Mushishi but post-apocalyptic. Quiet devastation.

### Ergo Proxy
*23 eps*

Domed city, androids developing emotions, conspiracy. Dense and philosophical, requires your full attention.

**Vibe:** For people who wished Psycho-Pass and Ghost in the Shell had a baby.

### ID: Invaded
*13 eps*

Technology that lets detectives dive into the unconscious minds of serial killers. The catch: only someone who has killed can use it. Original psychological thriller that rewards paying attention.

**Vibe:** Minority Report meets Inception with a murder mystery.

---

## Lighter (But Still Good)

### Delicious in Dungeon
*24 eps*

Party must rescue their member from a dragon. To save time, they cook and eat the monsters. Sounds like pure comedy. By the end, you'll be emotionally devastated.

**Vibe:** Starts as a cooking show, ends somewhere else entirely.

### Barakamon
*12 eps*

Calligrapher exiled to rural island learns to stop being uptight. Similar healing energy to Usagi Drop (which you loved). Heartwarming without being sappy.

**Vibe:** Grumpy artist learns what matters from weird island child.

### Dandadan
*12 eps, ongoing*

Kid who believes in ghosts meets kid who believes in aliens. Both are right. "Occult horror sci-fi action romantic comedy." The standout of Fall 2024.

**Vibe:** Unhinged in the best way.

## Movies

### Look Back (2024)
*58 min*

Two girls bond over creating manga. From the Chainsaw Man creator. A love letter to artists that doesn't shy away from the pain. 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Letterboxd's highest-rated animation of 2024.

**Vibe:** Making art is beautiful and terrible and you will cry.

### The First Slam Dunk (2022)
*124 min*

You don't need to know basketball or the source material. Best animation and cinematography in a sports film, period. Multiple reviewers reported sobbing throughout. Fifth highest-grossing anime film ever.

**Vibe:** Sports anime that transcends being a sports anime.

### In This Corner of the World (2016)
*129 min*

Young woman's life near Hiroshima during WWII. Similar subject to Grave of the Fireflies but more hopeful, ultimately. Still devastating.

**Vibe:** War through the eyes of someone just trying to live.

### The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013)
*137 min*

Studio Ghibli retelling of the bamboo cutter tale. Unique watercolor style. A celestial being experiences the beauty and tragedy of mortal life.

**Vibe:** What if being human was the most precious and painful thing?
