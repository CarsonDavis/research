# Setting Up Research Guidelines

## Message 1
> in our base readme i want to outline our research philosophy: we have folders for each topic we research. in the folder we make a ...well , basically i want to generalize this process but for arbitrary subjects. with the idea that we do careful background reasarch that we write to and then make a report

<pasted the fossil one here>

## Message 2
> report phase needs work. i value executive summaries that maintain key details, as well as tables that show easy comparisons, but only when they aren't too subjective but are driven by clear factors. the summary should be driven by whatever the research topic is

## Message 3
> ok, i put this in research guidelines. next i want to add a file on using python effectively. UV, dry, modular. a focus on code that is clear and easy to update. whenever we code, we should create a readme for what the code will do prior to starting coding. once we are finished, we should check against the readme and either update it to reflect reality or revist our code. at the beginning, we should always know the clear functional requirements as well as the plan to implement

## Message 4
> ok, let's make one for using git. we can add and commit only when the user says to. we should add whatever was recently worked on, or what the user specifies. we should never write a bunch about claude code in the commit message

## Message 5
> we need to be clear that we add first so the user can examine the files, and only then do we commit

## Message 6
> ok, lets make a claude md that points to these three files. also standardize the naming for caps where appropriate

## Message 7
> no, the readme talks about the whole projcet. what you have called readme is research guidelines. call off of these guidelines except claude

## Message 8
> ok, lets git add the stuff for guidelines etc

## Message 9
> let's commit

## Message 10
> in research guidelines, do we ahve anything about how to choose the timlinness of sources? like if we are researching a fast moving field the sources need to be very recent

## Message 11
> add it

## Message 12
> in our overall readme, it should just say that this repo lets me research topics and provides clear guidelines on how it should work

## Message 13
> you can add a little more info lol. an overview of each of the files. consices

## Message 14
> our claude.md isn't cutting it. we need to be explicit with examples. if the user wants to code go read... research go read

## Message 15
> add an examples section

## Message 16
> we're missing something in our research guidelines. if there is something where we need to sus out user requirements we should start by asking a short list of probing questions and creating a requirments md

# Adding Chat Log Guidelines

## Message 17
> i want to update our claude.md to have instructinos on how to make a chat log, and then make a chatlog file instruction. check the repo for how to do it and see what we've already been doing with all our files and stuff. then add my messages here to the main chat log

## Message 18
> what are you doing. make a dedicated file and link it. don't pollute our claude

## Message 19
> ok, let's add some details that specify that if we are logging in a conversation, and there is an existing chat log we should give the new section a title and add on to it. like, "Clarify ...." "Build Book Recommender System"
